## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to run this project locally, simply run the following commands in your desired directory.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Ilyas-Codes/eCourse.git

# Start the PocketBase server
cd server
./pocketbase serve
# Open up the Admin UI and sign in with the following credentials: admin@ecourse.com & ecourseadmin

# Start the vite server
cd client
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Customization

All the landing page content (logo, hero headline etc) can be customized from the `config.json` file in the `client/src` directory.

You can also change the accent and background colors used throughout the app from the `tailwind.config.js` file in the `client` directory.

The PocketBase backend can basically be treated as a CMS for managing your course's content, the demo provided in this repo comes with 2 collections "modules" & "lessons" which include some placeholder data, you can simply change the data with your own. and you're good to go!

## Deployment

The most straightforward method to deploy eCourse is by running the command `npm run build` in the `client` directory. This command spits out a `dist` folder containing an optimized and production-ready bundle. after that, you can create a `pb_public` directory within the `server` directory and place the contents of the `dist` folder inside of there. With these steps completed, you are now ready to deploy your entire application, encompassing both the frontend and backend, on any cloud service provider.
